                <h3>Menstruation Overview</h3>
                <p>Menstruation (Days 0-7), commonly known as the menstrual period, marks the beginning of the menstrual cycle.
                     It typically lasts 3 to 7 days but can vary. During this phase, the uterine lining, which thickened
                      in preparation for a possible pregnancy, sheds and exits the body through the vagina.
                       Menstruation is controlled by hormonal changes, specifically a drop in estrogen and progesterone.</p>

                <h3>Menstruation: Physical Changes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Bleeding:</b> Flow can vary, but on average, a woman loses about 30-40 milliliters of blood during her period.</li>
                    <li>Cramps: Many women experience uterine cramps as the uterus contracts to expel its lining.</li>
                    <li>Fatigue: Hormonal changes can contribute to feelings of tiredness.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Appropriate workouts include walking and flexibility training</p>

                <h3>Follicular Phase Overview</h3>
                <p>The follicular phase (Days 8-13) begins on the first day of menstruation and lasts until ovulation. 
                    It is characterized by the development of ovarian follicles, each containing an immature egg. 
                    Hormones, particularly follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), stimulate the growth of these follicles.</p>

                <h3>Follicular Phase: Physical Changes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rise in Estrogen: Estrogen levels increase, leading to the thickening of the uterine lining.</li>
                    <li>Improved Mood: Many women report increased energy and a better mood during this phase.</li>
                    <li>Growth of Follicles: Multiple follicles develop in the ovaries, but typically only one becomes dominant.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Appropriate workouts include cardio and strength training</p>

                <h3>Ovulation Overview</h3>
                <p>Ovulation (Days 14-17) marks the midpoint of the menstrual cycle and occurs around the 14th day in a typical 28-day cycle.
                     The mature follicle bursts, releasing an egg into the fallopian tube. 
                    This is a crucial phase for fertility, as it is the most fertile time in the menstrual cycle.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Increase in Body Temperature: Basal body temperature rises slightly after ovulation.</li>
                    <li>Cervical Mucus Changes: Cervical mucus becomes clear, slippery, and stretchy, resembling egg whites.</li>
                    <li>Libido Peaks: Some women experience an increase in sexual desire.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Appropriate workouts include high-intensity interval training</p>

                <h3>Luteal Phase Overview</h3>
                <p>The luteal phase (Days 17-31) begins after ovulation and lasts until the start of the next menstrual period.
                     After the follicle releases the egg, it transforms into a structure called the corpus luteum,4
                    which produces progesterone to prepare the uterus for a potential pregnancy.</p>

                    <li>Breast Tenderness: Some women may experience breast tenderness or swelling.</li>
                    <li>Mood Changes: Hormonal fluctuations can lead to mood swings or irritability.</li>
